# Hello.
My name is samwashington. I've been a developer since 2013.

Most of the projects I've worked on for my own sake are centered around ideological representation.

## I like Language
I believe that having access to language is foundational to understanding the world.

For the past four years, I've been exploring this concept in the domain of self-directed learning.

This exploration has culminated in a language project that I'm pretty excited to develop.

It's served as a good excuse to dig into other languages and ecosystems.

## My favorite projects

I'm working on a project that IMO is *pretty neat*. 
It's called [Boon Land](https://boon.land). 

Unfortunately I can't say tooo much about Boon Land, since part of its concept os the story of development. More on this later!

## Also!

I'm looking for a job. Hiring me is a _very cool_ and _very good_ thing to do.

about the language used, as I'm mainly interested in what can be done with them.
