# Hello.

My name is samwashington. I've been a developer since 2013.

Most of the projects I've worked on for my own sake are centered around ideological representation, specifically as it can relate to self-directed learning.

## Hire me

I'm looking for a job now. Generally, I'm not picky about the language used, as I'm mainly interested in what can be done with them.

## My projects

The biggest project I've been working on is a language called Spw. I'll be releasing version 1.0.0 on my birthday, Jan 1.
