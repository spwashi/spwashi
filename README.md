# Hello.

My name is samwashington. I've been a developer since 2013.

Most of the projects I've worked on for my own sake are centered around ideological representation.

## I like Language

I believe that having access to [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system) is foundational to understanding the world.

For the past four years, I've been exploring this concept in the domain of self-directed learning.

This exploration has culminated in a language project that I'm pretty excited to have presentable (soon). 

It's served as a good excuse to dig into other languages and ecosystems.

## Hire me

I'm looking for a job now. Generally, I'm not picky about the language used, as I'm mainly interested in what can be done with them.

## My projects

The most involvd personal project I've been working on is a language called Spw. I'll be releasing version 1.0.0 on my birthday, Jan 1.
